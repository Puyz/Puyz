## Professional Summary

I am a **Full Stack .NET Engineer** focused on designing, evolving, and operating
**enterprise-scale distributed systems**.

My expertise goes beyond layered architectures such as **N-Tier**, **Onion**, and **Clean Architecture**.
I actively design and build **microservice-based systems** incorporating **API Gateways**, **asynchronous messaging**,
and **service-to-service communication** patterns.

I apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to model complex business domains and use
**CQRS**, **Event Sourcing**, and **event-driven architectures** where scalability,
auditability, and consistency boundaries are critical.

On the frontend, I build **React-based applications** with an architectural mindset,
ensuring frontend systems remain predictable, maintainable, and aligned with backend domains.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Architecture is a long-term business decision, not a framework choice
- Clear boundaries are more valuable than clever abstractions
- Distributed systems must be observable, resilient, and failure-aware
- Consistency is a strategy, not a default
- Code should explain the system, not hide it

---

## Architectural Scope

- Microservices and modular monoliths
- API Gateway patterns (routing, auth, cross-cutting concerns)
- Domain-Driven Design (bounded contexts, aggregates, invariants)
- CQRS with task-based and event-based flows
- Event Sourcing for critical domains
- N-Tier / Onion / Clean Architecture as internal service structure
- Dependency inversion and contract-first design

---

## Distributed Systems & Messaging

- RabbitMQ-based messaging and pub/sub
- Event-driven and message-driven architectures
- Saga pattern (Orchestration & Choreography)
- Outbox / Inbox pattern
- Eventual consistency vs strong consistency trade-offs
- Correlation ID, traceability, and observability
- Background workers and async processing pipelines

---

## Backend Engineering

- ASP.NET Core / .NET
- API Gateway design
- Authentication & Authorization
- Secure credential handling
- RESTful APIs and gRPC / RPC-style communication
- Redis caching, pub/sub, and distributed locks
- Transaction management in distributed environments

---

## Frontend Engineering

- React-based SPA development
- Redux and predictable state management
- Component-driven UI architecture
- Backend-aligned frontend contracts

---

## Data & Persistence

- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Redis
- Relational data modeling
- Event stores and append-only persistence
- Performance-aware data access strategies
